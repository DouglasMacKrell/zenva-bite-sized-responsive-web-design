## A [Zenva](https://academy.zenva.com/) Course

## [CERTIFICATION AWARDED](https://academy.zenva.com/certificate/113ffbbe/)

---

## TECHNICAL MILESTONES

* Learning that CSS Grid only affects direct decedents, and not every nested container within the parent
* Learning that the best universal rule of thumb for media queries is to use a width of 768 and 1200 to define phones, tablets, and browsers

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**

## LOCAL SETUP

**NOTE: You must have or install a web browser in your computer for this to run.**

1. Clone this repo into a folder of your choice:

       `git clone https://github.com/DouglasMacKrell/zenva-bite-sized-responsive-web-design.git`

2. Open `index.html`, `media-queries.html`, `grid.html`, or `flexbox.html` with your installed browser

3. A new browser tab should have been opened and the App should be running. If that is not the case check the terminals output for errors, if you are unable to troubleshoot the problem, I would be happy to address issues so open [one](/issues)
